# Achiever Policy and Ethos

1. Arbitrator MUST arbitrate taking this Policy when ruling Vows from Achiever. If that ever stopped being the case, users of Achiever MUST choose another Arbitrator. This is an abstract Policy for all Vows, and creators of Vows are encouraged to redact a Policy for their own Vows to make things more clear.

2. Analysis

Analysis can be performed by using Semantics, Mathematics, Statistics, or any other tool to process empirical data. Common Sense alone can be used to forge facts a priori, and is as such invalid as a tool. Persuasion must be dismissed in favor of cold facts. Other tools of scientific nature are also valid. In case of conflict:
- Inference beats Induction.
- Natural science beats social science.

3. Evidence

Evidence Y that proves X is defined as an effect with a set of possible past causes with a characteristic X in common. If there is any possible past state without characteristic X that concludes in Y, then it is not evidence. However, 5-sigma results are considered empirical evidence. This means that if for Y to not have happened, an extremely unlikely event would have had to take place, then it is evidence. Evidence does not have to be evident.

4. Validity of Evidence

Arbitrator SHOULD dismiss invalid evidence. In order to be valid, the evidence is coupled with an objective explanation. This explanation should state why the evidence is evidence, in other words, should make it more evident. Examples are explaining the chances or providing links that support the position. Insults, subjectivity, morality, fabrication of evidence, and attempts at persuasion or rethoric SHOULD be dismissed as invalid.

5. Abstract Computer

Arbitrator SHOULD arbitrate like an Abstract Computer. Current computers cannot take care of Creative Problem Solving or Natural Language tasks, but if they could, they would have been chosen to arbitrate this dapp. To cover these limitations, disputes are outsourced to the Arbitrator. Arbitration is expected to rule as a computer capable of abstract thought.

6. Reject Case Law

Arbitrator MUST NOT consider Case Law in any way or form. Disputes are analyzed individually per case. Following Case Law offers the possibility of repeating mistakes. Older disputes may be used as heuristics and experiences for learning, but cannot be introduced unless the Vow to be ruled is explicitly about older disputes.

7. Challenger's Claim

Arbitrator, unless specified otherwise in the Vow, MUST NOT rule according to the Vow in absolute terms. Arbitrator MUST rule according to the original Challenger's Claim against the Vow. If this Claim is valid, and the evidence denounced by this Claim makes the Vow Failed, then it must be ruled as Failed. Rule Clear otherwise, even if this Vow has Failed for any other reason.

8. When in doubt, rule Clear

Existence of doubt doesn't cause Clear to be the correct ruling straight away, but doubtful claims are not enough to make a Vow Fail.
