# Achiever
Achiever is a dapp in which the users make a promise and put their money where their mouth is.

This is a solo-project for a [4-day Kleros Hackathon](https://blog.kleros.io/kleros-conference-law-memes-crowds-and-blockchain/).
The dapp consists on a static page and a Solidity contract. The static page approach is preferred in this implementation so that it can be hosted in ipfs. Evidence and claims are transferred using ipfs. Under certain rules that must be followed, users may challenge the promise by also staking some funds, and then Kleros will act as an oracle.
Stakes and appeals are made using *ETH*.
